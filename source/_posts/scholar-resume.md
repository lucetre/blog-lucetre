**[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)** is a blockchain-based **P2E** game. Players purchase NFTs of cute monsters called Axies and then pit them against each other in battles. They can earn SLP tokens during gameplay and trade them for money at an exchange.

The Axie scholarship program lets **scholars** willing to play the game possess one or more decks to play Axie infinity. The scholarship **managers** buy or provide decks of 3 axies, enabling the scholar to play battles. The scholar's SLP revenue follows a 50/50 or 60/40 payout ratio depending on the scholars' performance.

We have launched **Scholar Resume SPA** for axie scholars to apply for a specific scholarship, providing achievement information, including their ranks, MMR, and earned SLP history via their playing accounts.
