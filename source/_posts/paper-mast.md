* This article is all about a recently-viewed paper, [**Multi-Aspect Streaming Tensor Completion**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3097983.3098007) in proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '17).

* **Abstract**
  * Completion of incremental tensors without sacrificing effectiveness remains a challenging task due to the uncertainty of tensor mode changes and complex data structure of multi-aspect streaming tensors. To bridge this gap, we propose a Multi-Aspect Streaming Tensor completion framework based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition to track the subspace of general incremental tensors for completion. 
* **Relevance to My Research**
  * MAST is the 1st approach to online analysis that solved the multi-aspect streaming problem.
  * I'm also working on streaming tensor and trying to develop my method. You can see the progress of my research on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucetre/online-tensor-decomposition).
